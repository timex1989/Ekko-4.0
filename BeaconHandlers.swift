// If you have other helper methods unrelated to Lottie, you can keep them here.
// Here is a simple skeleton you can build on:

struct BeaconHandlers {
    // Example non-Lottie helper method
    static func someOtherHelperFunction() {
        // ...your non-Lottie helper code here...
    }
    
    // Add any additional non-Lottie utilities as needed.
}
